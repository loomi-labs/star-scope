# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
    handle /starscope.grpc* {
        reverse_proxy envoy:8090
    }

    handle /cosmos-login {
        reverse_proxy client-cosmos-login:3000
    }

    handle {
        root * /var/www/star-scope
        encode gzip
        file_server
        try_files {path} /
    }
